--Performance is generally good and optimized in modern JavaScript environments.

Bluebird Promise:
--Known for additional performance optimizations.
--Can be faster in certain scenarios, making it suitable for high-performance applications.

3.Syntax:

Bluebird Promise:
--Similar basic syntax but introduces additional methods and options.

4.Compatibility:

JavaScript Promise:
